    This is one of Noel's favorite weeknight meals.

\ingredients{
    1 & 6lb chicken \\
      & kosher salt \\
      & pepper \\
}

Using a pairing knife, create openings in the skin near the breast and the drumsticks. Get under the skin with the handle of a wooden spoon, and create separation. This will help develop a crisper skin.

Using your hands, spread a generous amount of salt and pepper on top of the skin, under the skin, and inside the main cavity. This will help keep the meat moist under high heat.

Place the chicken on a stainless steel pan, tend loosely with paper towels and place in the fridge over night. This will help dry out the skin while the salt is absorbed by the meat.

The next day, preheat the oven to 425. Remove the paper towel and place the pan with the chicken in the oven. Cook for 90 minutes. Don't worry about over-cooking the chicken; we want to make sure we're melting all the collagen in the meat.

\ingredients{
    1lb & green beans, ends removed \\
      1 & shallot \\
      1 & lemon \\
        & kosher salt \\
        & butter \\
}

When the chicken is done, remove pan from oven and place the chicken on a wire rack to rest.

Slice shallot and saut√© in the hot pan with some salt. Use the moisture from the shallots to loosen the bits of fond in the pan.

Add a pad of butter, the green beans, and more salt. Cook over medium high heat for 10 minutes. Add lemon juice and stir to combine.

Slice chicken and serve.
