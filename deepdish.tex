\section{Deep Dish Pizza}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    Instead of a pizza stone, we use a large square brick we bought at Home Depot for three dollars.

    Real deep dish is made with the sauce on top. I prefer the other way around, so that the cheese has a chance to brown.
}

\ingredients{
    3\sfrac{1}{4} & cups flour \\
     \sfrac{1}{2} & cup cornmeal \\
                2 & teaspoons salt \\
                2 & teaspoons sugar \\
                1 &  packet yeast \\
    1\sfrac{1}{4} & cups warm water \\
                3 & tablespoons melter butter \\
}

Mix dry ingredients in stand mixer. Add water and melted butter, and mix on medium-high for 5 minutes.

Empty the dough into an oiled bowl, turn to coat surface, and let rise for 1 hour.

Empty dough onto the counter top, and use a rolling pin to flatten into a 12 by 15 inch rectangle. Slather with softened butter, and roll into a cylinder, like a jelly roll.

Flatten the cylinder into an 18 by 4 inch rectangle with the rolling pin. Cut in half, and fold the ends of each half in on itself, like a letter.

Shape each half into a rough ball, and place back into the oiled bowl for 1 hour to rise.

Shape the dough to cover the pan surface, as well as one inch up the sides. If the dough resist shaping, let sit for 10 minutes and try again.

Poke holes in the dough with a fork.

\ingredients{
    28 & ounces crushed tomatoes \\
     1 & tablespoon olive oil \\
     1 & tablespoon tomato paste \\
     1 & clove garlic \\
       & red pepper flakes \\
       & kosher salt \\
}

In a dutch oven over medium heat, brown tomato paste with olive oil. Add garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook for 30 seconds. Add crushed tomatoes simmer for 15 minutes. Salt to taste.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{3}{4} & pound mozzarella cheese \\
                 & pepperoni \\
}

Top the warm crust with tomato sauce, cheese and pepperoni.

Bake for 25 minutes, until cheese is browned. Rest for 15 full minutes and then remove from baking dish before serving.
