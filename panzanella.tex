\pre{
    When you make a salad with wet ingredients like tomatoes, often times you get a pool of juice in the bottom of the bowl.
    This recipe, also known as Italian Bread Salad, soaks up that flavorful juice with toasted bread.
    The key is to let the salad rest for 10 minutes while the bread soaks up the juices.
}

\ingredients{
    1 & loaf rustic bread \\
    2 & tablespoons olive oil \\
      & salt
}

Slice the bread into 1 inch cubes. Smaller cubes are better than larger cubes - you
want them to be the same size as the tomato halves. Toss with olive oil and salt and place
cubes on a rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet, and toast at 400\degree{} for
20 minutes, or until golden brown.

\ingredients{
    1 & pint cherry tomatoes \\
    1 & shallot \\
      & fresh basil \\
      & salt \\
}

Slice cherry tomatoes in half. Slice shallot and basil. Salt in a bowl,
and let drain 20 minutes, reserving the liquid.

\ingredients{
                3 & tablespoons red wine vinegar \\
     \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
}

Whisk oil and vinegar, set aside. Combine all ingredients and toss to coat,
adding reserved tomato liquid. Season with salt and pepper.
