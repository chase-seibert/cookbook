    When you make a salad with wet ingredients like tomatoes and cucumber, often times you get a pool of juice in the bottom of the bowl.
    This recipe, also known as Italian Bread Salad, soaks up that flavorful juice with toasted bread.
    The key is to let the salad rest for 10 minutes while the bread soaks up the juices.
