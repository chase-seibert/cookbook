\section{Buffalo Chicken Burritos}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    If the oil is hot enough, it will bubble furiously when you add the chicken.
}

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup blue cheese \\
    \sfrac{3}{4} & cup mayonnaise \\
    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup sour cream  \\
               2 & tablespoons milk \\
}

Whisk to combine in a small bowl, and refrigerate for at least an hour for the flavors to come together.

\ingredients{
    2 & pounds chicken tenders \\
    2 & cups flour \\
    2 & eggs \\
    1 & cup panko bread crumbs \\
}

Beat the eggs and put then in a shallow dish. Place the bread crumbs in another shallow dish. Place the flour in a small container with a lid, large enough to hold a few tenders.

Coat each piece of chicken with flour, and shake off the excess. Dip each side into the egg mixture, then place in the bread crumb container.

When you have three tenders in the bread crumbs, put the lid on a shake to coat each piece.

Remove chicken pieces to a wire rack, keeping as many of the bread crumbs adhered as possible.

Let the chicken rest for 20 minutes on the wire rack.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup rice \\
               1 & cup water \\
               2 & tablespoons butter \\
}

Bring the water to a boil, then add the rice. When the water starts to boil again, reduce heat to low and put on the liquid.

\ingredients{
    1 & small container of crisco \\
}

Add the Crisco to a heavy 12 inch frying pan over medium heat. When the oil reaches 350\degree, add the first piece of chicken.

Cook the chicken until it's fully browned, about three minutes a side. If it browns too quickly, don't be afraid to flip or remove it, and finish it in a 350\degree oven for more even cooking.

Let the cooked chicken rest for 15 minutes, then chop it roughly into one inch pieces.

\ingredients{
    12 & inch flour tortillas \\
     2 & stalks celery \\
}

Heat up the tortillas for 60 seconds in the microwave. Once at a time, roll each tortilla with rice, chicken, blue cheese sauce and celery roughly chopped.
