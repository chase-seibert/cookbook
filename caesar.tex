\begin{recipe}

\tip{
    A Caesar salad has so few components. You really need to make each one excellent, 
    and take no shortcuts. Don't use too much cheese, or the salad will be dry.

    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup olive oil \\
              5  & garlic cloves \\
}

Simmer smashed garlic cloves in oil for 10 minutes to flavor the oil.

}

Cut whole leaves off of the root, and place in an ice bath for up to two hours. Drain and spin with a salad spinner, and place in the refrigerator.

You can make this up to two hours ahead of time, and re-blend it when you're ready to serve. 

Using a blender, combine everything except olive oil, scraping down the sides of the blender. Drizzle in olive oil slowly.
