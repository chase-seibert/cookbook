\section{Caesar Salad}
\begin{recipe}

\tip{
    A Caesar salad has so few components. You really need to make each one excellent, 
    and take no shortcuts. Don't use too much cheese, or the salad will be dry. Substituting olive oil in the dressing will make it turn bitter in the blender.

\ingredients{
               1 & small ciabatta bread \\
    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup olive oil \\
              5  & garlic cloves \\
}

Simmer smashed garlic cloves in oil for 10 minutes to flavor the oil.

Cut bread into \sfrac{1}{2} inch cubes. Toss with olive ol and spread on a baking sheet.

Bake at 400\degree{} for 7 minutes. Remove to bowl, toss, and return to oven for 4 minutes so that crutons brown evenly. Repeat until very well browned. 

\ingredients{
    2 & heads romaine hearts \\
}

Cut whole leaves off of the root, and place in an ice bath for 30 minutes. Drain and spin with a salad spinner, and place in the refrigerator to dry off for 30 minutes.

\ingredients{
            2 & tablespoon mayonainse \\
            2 & tablespoons lemon juice \\
            8 & anchovy fillets (full small tin) \\
            4 & cloves garlic \\
            1 & teaspoon dijon mustard \\
            3 & oz parmesan reggiano \\
 \sfrac{1}{2} & cup canola or vegetable oil \\
}

Combine everything in a blender. You can cut the parmesan into chunks. 

You can make this up to two hours ahead of time, and re-blend it when you're ready to serve. 

Dress the salad, using only half the dressing to start. You can always add more. Serve with extra parmesan, and fresh pepper.
