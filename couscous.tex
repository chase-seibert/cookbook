\section{Couscous Salad}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    Couscous has a tendency to clump together. Ideally, we want every kernel to be separate.
}

\ingredients{
    4 & cups plain couscous \\
}

Follow the directions on the box to hydrate couscous.
Immediately after the couscous is cooked, turn out into another metal bowl. Don't let it
sit too long, or it will clump up. Break any clumps with a wooden spoon.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
    1 & lemons juiced \\
    1 & teaspoon kosher salt \\
    3 & tablespoons Dijon mustard \\
}

Emulsify the dressing and stir into the couscous.

\ingredients{
    12 & ounces feta cheese \\
    1 & orange bell pepper \\
    1 & yellow bell pepper \\
    1 & large red onion \\
    5 & tablespoons minced mint \\
      & sliced cherry tomatoes \\
}

Dice the peppers and onion fine, and combine with rest in the couscous bowl.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.
