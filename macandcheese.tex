\pre{
    This is the actual recipe for a favorite side-dish from Fleming's Steak House in Boston. The recipe was published on the web by their head chef.
    Don't use sharp or extra sharp cheddar, or it will be a little grainy. 
    If you can also throw in 3 slices of American cheese, the final dish will be much creamier.
