\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    The scalloped potatoes can be prepped ahead of time, even the day before. Simply pause at the step when they go into the oven, and refrigerate instead.

\subsection{Ham}

\tip {
    Many recipes suggest that 10-15 minutes per pound is sufficient. I find that this can leave an inner core that is barely re-heated, and has a soft texture. You can't really over-cook a ham. I prefer to cook for 20 minutes a pound, which develops a better crust anyway.
}

\ingredients{
    1 & large ham, bone in \\
    3 & apples \\
    2 & onions \\
    1 & cup water \\
    1 & cup brown sugar \\
}

Quarter apples and onions and place in the bottom of a roasting pan along with the water.

Score the surface of the ham with a cross hatch pattern at once inch intervals.

Place ham on a rack in the roasting pan. With your hands, pack brown sugar on to the sides of the ham.

Roast in the oven at 350\degree for 20 minutes per pound.

\ingredients{
    1 & cup apple jelly \\
}

With 90 minutes remaining on the roast time, remove ham from oven and brush with the jelly. Return to oven.

After the ham has reseted, take the largest section off the bone and slice thinly.

\subsection{Gastrique Sauce}

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{3} & cup side vinegar \\
}

Remove ham from oven, and remove rack from the roasting pan. Set aside and tent loosely for foil for at least 30 minutes.

To make the sauce, remove solids from the roasting pan surface, and add cider vinegar. Simmer lightly on the stove top, until reduced to taste. You can also season with salt and pepper.

When the sauce is reduced to a good volume and has good flavor, reduce heat to low or just turn the stove off and let the pan keep the sauce warm.

Pass the sauce at the table, separately from the ham.

\subsection{Scalloped Potatoes}

\tip{
    I like a strong garlic flavor in these which is non-traditional. You can make these in a regular dutch oven, but if you have an over-sized dutch oven, that will pre-cook the potatoes more evenly.
}

\ingredients{
    2 & tablespoons butter \\
    1 & large onion \\
    3 & cups heavy cream \\
    2 & garlic cloves \\
    2 & bay leaves \\
      & fresh thyme \\
      & kosher salt \\
}

Mince onion and saut√© in butter with salt. Add cream, and bring to simmer. Add minced garlic and bay leaves. Tie thyme springs into a bunch and steep in the cream.

\ingredients {
    5 & lbs russet potatoes
}

Peal potatoes, and slice to \sfrac{1}{8} inch. This is best done on a mandolin. Add potatoes to cream, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until they feel soft when poked with a pairing knife.

Remove thyme spring, and pour potatoes and cream into a large baking dish. Shallower is better.

\ingredients {
    8 & ounces Gruyere \\
}

Top potatoes with shredded cheese, and bake at 350\degree for 20 minutes. Broil briefly for color.
