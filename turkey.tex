\subsection{Green Bean Casserole}

\ingredients{
    6 & slices white bread \\
    2 & tablespoons butter \\
    1 & can fried onions \\
}

Pulse bread and butter in food processor with salt and pepper. Toss with fried onions.

\ingredients {
    2              & pounds green beans \\
}

Trim and halve green beans. Boil for 6 minutes and cool in an ice water bath.

\ingredients {
    2              & pound button mushrooms \\
    4              & tablespoons butter \\
    3              & garlic cloves \\
    3              & tablespoons flour \\
    4 & cups chicken broth \\
    1\sfrac{1}{2} & cup heavy cream \\
}

Sauté mushrooms, broken in to pieces, with butter and salt. Add garlic. Add flour and cook for one minute. Add liquids and simmer for 4 hours to reduce. It's even better if you make it the night before. Toss with green beans. Place into 9x13 baking dish. Don't add topping until it's ready to go into the oven.

Bake at 425 for 15 minutes. 30 minutes if it starts cold. 

\subsection{Stuffing}

\tip {
    Try using two different kinds of bread. I've had good luck with Brioche, challah, sourdough and rye. You can also use three smaller loaves. 
}

\ingredients{
    2 & loaves of bread \\
}

Cube bread into \sfrac{1}{2} inch pieces. Toast in the oven at 300\degree{} for 30 minutes, until it's very dry and toasted. You can do two pans in the oven, at once. 

\ingredients{
    2 & onions \\
    4 & ribs of celery \\
    3 & cups chicken broth \\
    3 & tablespoons butter \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}


In dutch oven, sauté onion and celery in butter with salt until just starting to brown. Add broth and bring to simmer. If you want to add seasonings, rosemary, thyme, and fennel are all good. Toss with bread cubes until the broth is absorbed. If it seems dry, add more plain chicken stock. 

\subsection{Turkey}

\pre{
    A 12 pound turkey is plenty for eight people. For up to 18 pounds, you don't need to increase the cooking time at all.
}

\ingredients{
                     & 12 pound turkey \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup kosher salt \\
}

At least 48 hours before roasting, remove turkey from wrapping and place in the sink.
Wash with water, and remove and reserve gizzard and neck pieces.

Create half inch slits with a knife at the ends of the breasts and the drumsticks.
Using the handle of a wooden spoon, separate the skin from the meat underneath.

Using your hands, rub a generous amount of salt directly onto the meat.
Err on the side of over-salting, versus under salting. Really, add more salt.
Also salt inside the main cavity.

Tent loosely with a paper towel and put in the refrigerator.

Place in roasting pan on a raised rack, slather with softened butter, and roast at 425\degree{} for one hour.

Lower oven to 325\degree{}. Remove turkey, and take out the raised rack.
Empty any liquid in the pan into a bowl and reserve for gravy.

Place the stuffing into the bottom of the roasting pan. Press the stuffing down to compress us, using the bottom of a glass or a pot. Put the raised rack
and turkey on top of the stuffing, and return to oven for another two hours. Check 30 minutes
ahead to make sure it's not already done. You can keep a turkey warm for at least 90 minutes by covering with foil and putting a fleece blanket on top. 

\newpage
\subsection{Gravy}

\tip {
    I think this recipe for gravy without using the pan drippings is even better than with the pan drippings, and it allows you to absorb all the drippings into the stuffing.
}

\ingredients{
    1 & onion \\
    4 & celery ribs \\
      & reserved turkey pieces \\
}

In a dutch oven, melt butter and add onion and celery. Brown on medium high heat until very dark, but not burnt.

Add chopped up turkey gizzard, kidney and neck. Add some of the fat from the reserved pan drippings. Sauté until dark brown. This can go on low for hours.

\ingredients {
    4 & cups chicken broth \\
      & reserved turkey liquid \\
    1 & tablespoon cider vinegar \\ 
}

De glaze with chicken broth, add reserved roasting liquid, and vinegar. Gravy should be a dark brown. If you have any remaining herbs, add them now.

Bring to a fast simmer and reduce. At this point you can hold and reheat when you're almost ready for dinner.

Strain over a bowl to remove any solids, and return the gravy to the dutch oven. Don't strain out the fat. 

\ingredients {
    1 & cup water \\
    1 & tablespoon corn starch \\
}

Mix cornstarch and water in a glass until cornstarch is dissolved. Slowly whisk into gravy and bring to simmer, until thickened and glossy. 

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

\subsection{Mashed Potatoes}

\tip {
    5 pounds of mashed potatoes is fine for 10 people.
}

\ingredients{
    5 & pounds russet potatoes \\
    1 & stick butter \\
    1 & cup buttermilk \\
}

Steam one inch cubes for 20 minutes until easily pierced by a paring knife. User a ricer to break them down. Add a butter in chunks and stir in buttermilk. Cooking longer will do no harm, as long as you are employing a ricer. Mashed potatoes can be kept warm by placing in the microwave. 

\newpage
\subsection{Carving}

Drumsticks and wings should be removed first, by slipping a blade in between the knob joints.

The thighs are where most of the good dark meat comes from. It's between the drumsticks and the main body. There is a second joint there which must be separated, and then the dark meat can be removed from the bone. On a well cooked bird, you can remove the bone easily with just your fingers.

Remove the breasts before carving with sweeping motions between the backbone and the breast meat.
Once the breasts are separated, they can be sliced vertically on a cutting board.
I prefer them in one inch slices.
Though it's not how most people expect it to be served, larger pieces leave much more moisture in the meat.
