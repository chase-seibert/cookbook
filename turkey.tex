\section{Thanksgiving Dinner}
\begin{recipe}

The turkey temp should be 165\degree{} for the white meat, and 175\degree{} for the dark meat. It's OK if both go 10\degree{} over. Recipes are good for up to 12 adults and 5 young children.

\subsection{Green Bean Casserole}

\ingredients{
    6 & slices white bread \\
    2 & tablespoons butter \\
    1 & can fried onions \\
}

Pulse bread and butter in food processor with salt and pepper. Toss with fried onions.

\ingredients {
    2              & pounds green beans \\
}

Trim and quarter green beans. Halves are still too large. Boil for 6 minutes and cool in an ice water bath.

\ingredients {
    2              & pound button mushrooms \\
    1              & pound Shiitake mushrooms \\
    4              & tablespoons butter \\
    3              & garlic cloves \\
    3              & tablespoons flour \\
    4 & cups chicken broth \\
    1\sfrac{1}{2} & cup heavy cream \\
}

Sauté mushrooms, broken in to pieces, with butter and salt. Add garlic. Add flour and cook for one minute. Add liquids and simmer for 3 hours to reduce. It's OK if it's liquidy. Toss with green beans. Place into 9x13 baking dish. Don't add topping until it's ready to go into the oven.

Bake at 425\degree{} for 15 minutes. 30 minutes if it starts cold. 

\subsection{Stuffing}

\tip {
    Try using two different kinds of bread. I've had good luck with Brioche, challah, sourdough and rye. Don't stretch it to three loaves, the stuffing will be dry. 
}

\ingredients{
    2 & loaves of bread \\
}

Cube bread into \sfrac{1}{4} inch pieces. Toast in the oven at 300\degree{} for 30 minutes, until it's very dry and toasted. You can do two pans in the oven, at once. 

\ingredients{
    2 & onions \\
    4 & ribs of celery \\
    3 & cups chicken broth or turkey stock \\
    3 & tablespoons butter \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}


In dutch oven, sauté onion and celery in butter with salt until just starting to brown. Add broth and bring to simmer. If you want to add seasonings, rosemary, thyme, and fennel are all good. Toss with bread cubes until the broth is absorbed. It's OK if it's a little dry; it will absorb juices from the turkey. 

\subsection{Gravy}

\tip {
    I think this recipe for gravy without using the pan drippings is even better than with the pan drippings, and it allows you to absorb all the drippings into the stuffing. You can easily double this recipe using two dutch ovens. 
}

\ingredients{
    1 & onion \\
    4 & celery ribs \\
    8 & tablespoons butter (one stick) \\
      & reserved turkey pieces \\
}

In a dutch oven, melt butter and add onion and celery. Brown on medium high heat until very dark, but not burnt.

Add chopped up turkey gizzard, kidney and neck. Add some of the fat from the reserved pan drippings. Sauté until dark brown. This can go on low for hours.

\ingredients {
    4 & cups chicken broth \\
      & reserved turkey liquid \\
    1 & tablespoon cider vinegar \\ 
}

De glaze with chicken broth, add reserved roasting liquid, and vinegar. Gravy should be a dark brown. If you have any remaining herbs, add them now.

Bring to a fast simmer and reduce. At this point you can hold and reheat when you're almost ready for dinner.

Strain over a bowl to remove any solids, and return the gravy to the dutch oven. Don't strain out the fat. 

\ingredients {
    1 & cup water \\
    1 & tablespoon corn starch \\
}

Mix cornstarch and water in a glass until cornstarch is dissolved. Slowly whisk into gravy and bring to simmer, until thickened and glossy. 

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

\subsection{Mashed Potatoes}

\tip {
    5 pounds of mashed potatoes is fine for 18 people. 10 pounds is a ridiculous amount. Low fat buttermilk doesn't work, it will curdle. Substitute sour cream instead. 
}

\ingredients{
    5 & pounds russet potatoes \\
    1 & stick butter \\
    1 & cup buttermilk \\
      & chives or scallions \\
}

Start in cold water and boil for 20 minutes, longer is fine. User a ricer to break them down. Add a butter in chunks and stir in buttermilk gradually. Don't pre-heat buttermilk or it will curdle. Mashed potatoes can be kept warm by placing in the microwave.

\subsection{Turkey}

\pre{
    A 12 pound turkey is plenty for eight people. 22 pounds is plenty for 18 people. For up to 18 pounds, you don't need to increase the cooking time at all. Icing and flipping the tukey is worth it for well cooked dark meat. Let the turkey rest in the oven to give the dark meat even more time to come up to temperature. 
}

\ingredients{
                     & 12 pound turkey \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup kosher salt \\
}

48 hours before roasting, upwrap and separate gizzard and neck pieces. Salt liberally and use a knife to create fat draining slits on the dark meat area. 

One hour before roasting remove from refrigerator and put ice on the breasts. 

Place in roasting pan on a raised rack, upside down, on some foil so it doesn't stick. Brush with melted butter, and roast at 425\degree{} for one hour.

Lower oven to 325\degree{}. Remove turkey in the raised rack, and flip is over, removing foil. Empty any liquid in the pan into a bowl and reserve for gravy.

Place the stuffing into the bottom of the roasting pan. Press the stuffing down to compress. Put the turkey on top of the stuffing, and return to oven for another two hours. If it's cooking too fast, you can turn off the oven and prop open the door, and it will keep climbing 10\degree{}. You should remove the turkey from the oven when the breast reads 160\degree{}. A remote thermometer is critical. 

\subsection{Carving}

Drumsticks and wings should be removed first, by slipping a blade in between the knob joints.

The thighs are where most of the good dark meat comes from. It's between the drumsticks and the main body. There is a second joint there which must be separated, and then the dark meat can be removed from the bone. On a well cooked bird, you can remove the bone easily with just your fingers.

Remove the breasts before carving with sweeping motions between the backbone and the breast meat.
Once the breasts are separated, they can be sliced vertically on a cutting board.
I prefer them in one inch slices.
