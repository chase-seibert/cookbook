\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    This omelet does need any cheese, or fillings. By cooking on very low heat, and taking 
    it off before it's fully cooked, the eggs become custard-like, and actually taste cheesey.     
    Start with room temperature eggs. You can submerge the eggs in warm water for 20 minutes
    to bring them to room temperature. 
}

\ingredients{
    3 & eggs \\
    & kosher salt \\
}

Crack eggs into a bowl. Add kosher salt. Beat with a fork. Let eggs sit for 5 minutes.


\ingredients{
    1 & knob of butter \\
    1 & teaspoon dried dill \\
}

Melt butter in a 12 inch frying pan on low. I use my main burner for this, but on the lowest setting.

Add eggs, and do not stir at all. It will look like it's not cooking at all. 

Eventually, you will see little bubbles come up, and the bottom will be slightly opaque. 

Once you can shake the pan a little, and see that only the very top surface has uncooked egg, 
you're ready to fold. Flip the far edge of the eggs over using a spatula, and then use a wrist
flick to flip the whole thing over into thirds.
