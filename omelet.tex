\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    Start with room temperature eggs. This omelet is cooked on very low heat for tenderness.
    Don't add too much filling, and pre-cook any filling except cheese. Oil works better
    than butter for eggs; this is also for tenderness.
}

\ingredients{
    1 & bell pepper \\
    1 & small onion \\
}

Dice fine, and pre-cook over medium heat until the onions start to brown. Remove from heat and reserve.

\ingredients{
    3 & eggs, room temperature \\
    1 & teaspoon dried dill \\
      & pinch kosher salt \\
}

Crack eggs into a medium bowl, salt, and whisk lightly with dill.

\ingredients{
    3 & tablespoons vegetable oil \\
}

Heat the pan over low heat for five minutes. Coat with oil.

Pour egg mixture into the pan, and immediately stir with a spatula.
In just a few seconds, a few large curds will have formed. Shake the pan to redistribute raw egg into any gaps.

\ingredients{
    1 & ounce feta cheese \\
}

Top two thirds of the omelet with cheese, pepper and onion. Cook until the raw egg has firmed up everywhere, and bubbles have started to form.

Run the tip of a spatula around the rim of the omelet, separating it from the pan. Give the pan a shake. Using the spatula, flip the third of the omelet with no filling onto itself.

Slide the folded end of the omelet onto a plate, and flip the remaining part over the top.
