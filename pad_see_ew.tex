Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large saut√© pan over high heat. When hot, add all 
of the chicken and toss just fully cooked. Set aside.

\ingredients{
    2 & eggs \\

Each serving should be fried as a separate batch, so that the noodles char and don't steam.

For each serving, start with a little oil and garlic. Then, scramble the eggs. Add the broccoli. 
Add rice noodles and sauce. Stir to coat noodles. 

Let noodles fry without stirring until some of the noodles have charred. Flip and char again. Add back chicken. 

Remove to a single-serving bowl and start another batch.
