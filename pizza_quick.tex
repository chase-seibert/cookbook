\pre{
    Many supermarkets sell pre-made pizza dough. This dough can be frozen, even
    if it is fresh in the supermarket. Defrost by moving to the refrigerator
    two days in advance.

    Pre-heating the pizza stone for 45 minutes will improved the crust.

\ingredients{
    1 & pizza dough \\

Turn into a bowl well-coated with olive oil, cover in plastic wrap, and let
come to room temperature for two hours. You can also place in a 120\degree{} oven
for 1 hour.

Cut a large square of parchment paper, and empty pizza dough onto it. Lift the
edges with your hands and stretch it out a little. Then use the palms of your
hands to spread it further.

      1 & small can tomato paste \\

}

Saut√© tomato paste in olive oil over low heat for 10 minutes. Add
diced tomatoes, blend with a stick blender, and simmer for 10 minutes.

\ingredients{
    15 & ounces shredded mozzarella \\
     6 & ounces pepperoni \\
}

Cover dough with sauce, cheese and pepperoni. Cook on a pizza stone at 550\degree{} for 8 minutes

Let it cook until it looks like it's just turning dark brown. Remove from oven
and cool on wired rack.

    You can re-heat pizza by folding inside a aluminum foil envelope and placing
    in a 275\degree{} over for 25 minutes.
