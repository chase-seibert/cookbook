\section{Pickles}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    These are lacto-fermented pickles. Instead if using an acid like vinegar, they produce their own lactic acid through fermentation. The use of non-chlorinated water is required so as not to kill helpful microbes in the pickles and on the glass jars.
}

\ingredients{
    1 & lb pickling cucumbers \\
    6 & sprigs fresh dill \\
    1 & teaspoon kosher salt \\
    1 & garlic clove \\
      & non-chlorinated water \\
}

Quarter cucumbers length wise, and pack them tightly into wide mouthed mason jars.

Wedge dill sprigs down in between the cucumbers. Also wedge the garlic clove down there.

Top with kosher salt, and enough water to cover the cucumbers. You do not want them exposed to air.

Leave out at room temperature for 4 days. You should start seeing bubbling and other signs of fermentation by then.

Store in a cool cellar, or in the refrigerator, for up to a year.

\tip {
    You will know if your pickles are good by smell. It should smell strong, but pleasant. It should not smell spoiled or rotten.
}
