\section{Burnt Cheesecake}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    The top of this cheescake will be very dark, almost burned. The inside will be light and fluffy if you serve 
    after cooling for the minimum two hours. If refrigerated, it will have the same consistency as normal cheesecake.
    Goes well with any type of fruit compote topping. 
    All together it takes about 4 hours to make, including bringing the ingredients to room temperature.  
}

Pre-heat the oven to 425\degree{}. 

\ingredients{
    7 & eggs \\
    2 & cups sugar \\    
    36 & ounces cream cheese \\
    1 & cup heavy cream \\
    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup flour \\
}

Bring eggs and cream cheese to room temperature by submerging in lukewarm water for 30 minutes or leaving out on the counter for 2 hours. Combine sugar and eggs
in a food processor for 1 minute. Add cream cheese, heavy cream, and flour and process for 2 minutes. 

Cut two sheets of 12x16 inch parchment paper. Spray the sheets with a water bottle, and crumple into a ball. 
Flatten the sheets back out, and line the inside of a 9 inch spring form pan. Cut off excess paper from the sides. 

Bake for 45 minutes with a sheet pan underneath to catch drips. The batter will puff up above the pan. The center should be at least 155\degree, if it goes 
higher that's fine. It should still be very jiggly. 

Remove from oven, and cool for at least two hours before eating.

Slice using a knife rested in hot water.
