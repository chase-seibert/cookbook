\section{Pancakes}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    I used to make pancakes from scratch, using either buttermilk or buttermilk powder. 
    But it turns out that even basic pancake mix like Bisquick has all the basic ingredients 
    I was using, and nothing more. This make 5 medium pancakes. 
}

\ingredients{
               1 & cup pancake mix \\
               1 & teaspoon sugar \\
}

Whisk in a large bowl to combine.

\ingredients{
    1 & egg \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup of whole milk \\
    1 & dash of vanilla extract \\
}

Beat egg in a separate bowl, and add milk and vanilla extract. 

Combine wet and dry ingredients, stir well with a spatula to combine. Make sure to 
get any of the dry bits. 

\ingredients{
    & vegetable oil \\
}

Preheat an electric griddle to 375\degree{}. You can also use the largest frying pan you have over medium-low heat.

For each batch of pancakes, add vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan. You want a pool covering the entire surface.

Pour \sfrac{1}{4} cup of the batter onto an empty spot on the pan, and repeat until the pan is full.

After 90 seconds, flip them, and cook for 90 seconds.

Transfer the pancakes to a wire rack on a sheet pan while the others finish.
