\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    I used to make pancakes from scratch, using either buttermilk or buttermilk powder. 
    But it turns out that even basic pancake mix like Bisquick has all the basic ingredients 
    I was using, and nothing more. 
}

\ingredients{
               2 & cups pancake mix \\
               2 & teaspoons sugar \\
}

Whisk in a large bowl to combine.

\ingredients{
    2 & eggs \\
    1 & cup of whole milk \\
    1 & dash of vanilla extract \\
}

Beat eggs in a separate bowl, and add milk and vanilla extract. 

Combine wet and dry ingredients, stir well with a spatula to combine. Make sure to 
get any of the dry bits. 

\ingredients{
    & vegetable oil \\
}

Preheat an electric griddle to 375\degree{}. You can also use the largest frying pan you have over medium-low heat.

For each batch of pancakes, add 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the pan.

You want a pool covering the entire surface.

Pour \sfrac{1}{4} cup of the batter onto an empty spot on the pan, and repeat until the pan is full.

After about 80 seconds, flip them, and cook for 80 seconds.

Transfer the pancakes to a wire rack on a sheet pan while the others finish.
