\section{Southwest Caesar Salad}
\begin{recipe}

\pre {
    You can make your own caesar dressing, or you can use a store bought version.
    I prefer the creamy white style. Cotija is a dry, fresh Mexican farm cheese.
}

\ingredients{
    2 & marinated pepper steaks \\
}

Place steaks in a an oven safe dish and broil at 550\degree{} for 15 minutes, or until steaks are nicely charred. Set aside and tent with foil to rest for 20 minutes.

\ingredients {
    1 & cup caesar dressing \\
    1 & small can Chipotle in Adobo \\
    3 & limes \\
      & salt \\
}

Strain the chipotle peppers to separate them from the sauce. Discard peppers. Whisk together dressing, Adobo sauce and lime juice to taste. The Adobo sauce is very spicy. Season with salt.

\ingredients {
    3 & romaine hearts \\
    6 & ounces Cotija cheese \\
      & tortilla strips \\
      & black pepper \\

}

Slice steak thinly against the grain. Toss other ingredients with dressing to combine. Plate, and top with steak. Season with black pepper.

\tip {
    Try adding frozen corn broiled with olive oil and salt for an Elote salad.
}
