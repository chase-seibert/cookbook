\section{Lasagna}

\begin{recipe}

\pre {
    This is a kid-friendly lasagna, no ricotta or bechamel sauce. This will be even better 
    if you make it ahead of time and reheat it in the oven. Meatloaf mix (or raw meatloaf to be cooked) is sold 
    at many butcher counters; it's a mix of beef, veal and pork. You can also substitute 80/20 beef.
    One box of noodles is plenty for a medium lasagna. This will seem like a lot of sauce, but the lasagna 
    will absorb it. Total cooking time is 4 hours.

\ingredients{
    42 & ounces chuncky tomato sauce (2 large cans, 1 small can) \\
    28 & ounces San Marzano whole tomatoes in sauce (1 can) \\    
     1\sfrac{1}{2} & lbs meatloaf mix \\
     1 &  cup whole milk \\
     2 &  cloves garlic \\
     1 &  tablespoon tomato paste \\
     1 &  tablespoon red pepper flakes \\
     1 &  large onion \\
}

Chop onion fine, and saut√© in oil until just starting to brown. Add garlic and tomato paste and cook for 3 minutes.
Add meat and milk and bring to simmer. Add canned tomatoes, crushing the whole tomatoes with your hands. 
Simmer uncovered on the lowest heat for 2 hours.

\ingredients{
     1 & box regular Lasagna noodles \\
     2 & lbs block whole milk mozzarella, cubed \\
}

Boil noodles for just 4 minutes, or 4 minutes less than the cooking time. The idea is that they will finish in the oven,
and absorb the sauce. Drain noodles, and separate out on clean kitchen towels or baking sheets, so they do not stick together.

Pour a large ladle of sauce in the bottom of a smaller 9x13 baking dish, and spread it out.

Lay down a layer of six noodles, followed by a layer of cubed mozzarella, and a layer of sauce.

Repeat with a second layer. Don't use more than six noodles for the top layer, or it could buckle. 

\ingredients{
     2 & ounces Parmesan cheese \\
     1 & tablespoons garlic powder \\
}

Top with a final layer of noodles with enough tomato sauce so that there are no dry spots, more mozzarella, and the grated Parmesan.

Bake at 375\degree{} for 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven, and let cool for 30 minutes before serving.
