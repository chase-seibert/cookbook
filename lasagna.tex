\section{Lasagna}

\begin{recipe}

\pre {
    This is a kid-friendly lasagna, no ricotta or bechamel sauce. This will be even better 
    if you make it ahead of time and reheat it in the oven. Meatloaf mix is sold as such 
    in most grocery stores; it's a mix of beef, veal and pork. You can also substitute 80/20 beef.
    One box of noodles is plenty for a medium lasagna. 
}

\ingredients{
    28 & ounces diced tomatoes \\
    56 & ounces tomato puree (2 cans) \\
     1 &  pound meatloaf mix \\
     1 &  cup whole milk \\
     5 &  cloves garlic \\
     1 &  tablespoon tomato paste \\
     1 &  tablespoon red pepper flakes \\
     1 &  large onion \\
}

Chop onion fine, and saut√© in oil until just starting to brown. Add garlic and tomato paste and cook for 3 minutes.
Add meat and stir until it has lost the red color. Add milk and bring to simmer. Add canned tomatoes.
Simmer uncovered on the lowest heat for 3 hours.

\ingredients{
     1 & box regular Lasagna noodles \\
     1\sfrac{1}{2} & lbs block mozzarella, grated \\
}

Boil noodles for just 3 minutes, or 5 minutes less than the cooking time. The idea is that they will finish in the oven,
and absorb the sauce. Drain noodles, and separate out on clean kitchen towels or baking sheets, so they do not stick together.

Pour a large ladle of sauce in the bottom of a smaller 9x13 baking dish, and spread it out.

Lay down a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of grated mozzarella, and a layer of sauce.

Repeat with a second layer.

\ingredients{
    10 & ounces Parmesan cheese \\
     1 & tablespoons garlic powder \\
}

Top with a final layer of noodles with enough tomato sauce so that there are no dry spots, more mozzarella, and the grated Parmesan.

Bake at 375\degree{} for 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven, and let cool for 30 minutes before serving.
