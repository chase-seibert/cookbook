\section{Steak Tips}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    Almost anything could be labeled as steak tips in the grocery store. I use a cut that comes as a two inch square, foot long piece of loose fibered meat, and which is labeled simply "Steak tips".
}

\ingredients{
    1 & large onion \\
    3 & tablespoons butter \\
      & kosher salt \\
}

Cut onion into rings, and salt. Melt butter over medium heat in a saut√© pan. Add onions.

\ingredients{
    1 & pound sirloin steak tips \\
    1 & tablespoon butter \\
}

Pat meat dry with paper towels. In a large deep frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Increase heat to high and sear meat without moving it for three minutes a side.

Remove from heat, rest for 6 minutes and cut steak into 1\sfrac{1}{2} inch cubes.

\ingredients{
    1 & cup ketchup \\
    5 & tablespoons soy sauce \\
    1 & teaspoon malta \\
}

Whisk together wet ingredients in a small bowl. Combine with remaining ingredients in a small bowl.

Add sauce and steak tips into the large pan, spread out. Simmer on medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring every five minutes. The sauce will reduce and congeal, turning a darker brown.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

\ingredients{
    1 & package egg noodles \\
      & water \\
    4 & tablespoons butter \\
}

Bring water to a boil, add egg noodles and cook until al dente. Drain, return to pot and stir until sticky. Incorporate butter until melted.

Serve steak tips and sauce on top of the noodles.
