\section{Pot Roast}
\begin{recipe}

\ingredients{
    4 & pound chuck eye roast \\
}

Sprinkle liberally with kosher salt, and rest overnight in the refrigerator, lightly tented with paper towel.

Before cooking, bring the roast onto the counter and let it come up to room temperature, which can take up to two hours.

Pat the roast dry with paper towels, and brown all sides over medium-high heat in a large dutch oven. Reduce temperature if it starts to smoke. Remove roast to a plate.

\ingredients{
    1 & large onion \\
    1 & carrot \\
    1 & celery rib \\
    2 & whole garlic cloves \\
    1 & tablespoon kosher salt \\
}

Roughly chop vegetables, and add onions and salt to the pot, and cook until onions are just starting to brown. Add carrots, celery and garlic and cook for 5 more minutes.

\ingredients{
    1 & cup beef broth \\
    1 & cup red wine \\
    1 & sprig fresh thyme \\
}

Move the roast back to the pot, and add liquid until the level comes halfway up the roast. Better to have too little liquid than too much. Put in a 300\degree{} oven for 5 hours, flipping the roast half way through.

\tip{
    At the end, blend the sauce and root vegetables for a thicker sauce.
}

Baked red bliss potatoes are a good accompaniment. Then can either be placed on the bare oven rack, or added to the pot in the last two hours.
