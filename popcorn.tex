\pre{
    The key to this recipe is using plent of fat. Don't try to halve the recipe; 
    the kernels will not be submerged in enough fat, and will burn more easily. 
    Flavacol is a fine popcorn salt and seasoing that they use in movie theaters. 
    You can buy it online.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup popcorn kernels \\
    \sfrac{1}{3} & cup vegetable oil \\
    1\sfrac{1}{2} & tablespoons coconut oil \\
    1\sfrac{1}{2} & teaspoons Flavacol \\
}

Combine in a 9-inch pot. Put over medium heat, swirl to melt coconut oil and
combine, and place a cover on the pot. 

You don't need to shake or swirl the pot after the cover is on. 

Remove from heat when there are 1-2 seconds between pops. Immediately empty
into a large bowl, and let cool for 1 minute. 

\tip {
    You can put all kinds of toppings on popcorn. Some of my favorites are
    Zahtar spice, nutritional yeast, and white cheddar powder.
