\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    This recipe relies on a good parmesan cheese, and a good olive oil.
}

\ingredients{
               3 & large Italian sausages \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
               3 & cloves garlic \\
                 & red pepper flake \\
}

Heat over to 500\degree and turn on the broiler.

Remove casing from sausages with a sharp knife. Mince with a chefs knife until sausage bits are pea sized.

Shallow fry in olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until very browned, about 15 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and minced garlic in the last 30 seconds.

Drain sausage, reserving the oil.

\ingredients{
    1 & head broccoli \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}

Slice broccoli stalk into thin disks about 1/8 inch. This is easier with a  mandolin. Keep broccoli heads separate.

Toss stalks in 3 tablespoons of the reserved olive oil and a teaspoon of salt, and saut√© over high heat. After 5 minutes, add the broccoli heads with another three tablespoons of oil, and place under the broiler for 5 minutes, until slightly blackened.

\ingredients{
    1 & box Orecchiette pasta \\
}

Boil paste until al dente, as per box instructions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the water.

Immediately add the sausage and broccoli to the pasta. Toss to combine.

\ingredients{
    8 & ounces parmesan \\
}

Grate half the parmesan on the finest grater, and half on the coarse grater. When the paste has cooled for 5 minutes, toss with cheese.

Season with salt, pepper, and some of the remaining olive oil. Be careful not to make it too greasy.

Add some of the reserved water one tablespoon at a time to give it some body.
