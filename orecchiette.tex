\section{Broccoli Sausage Orecchiette}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    This recipe relies on a good parmesan cheese, and a good olive oil. Don't
    skimp on the full half cup of oil.
}

\ingredients{
               3 & large Italian sausages, or one package of sausage mix \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
               3 & cloves garlic \\
                 & red pepper flake \\
}

Pre-heat oven to 500\degree{}.

If using sausage, remove casing from sausages with a sharp knife.

Shallow fry in olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until
browned. Removed with a slotted spoon and process in a food processor for 3 short bursts. This will break up the sausage into the right sized pieces. Return to pan and brown for another 10 minutes on low heat.

Add red pepper flakes (even if using spicy sausage) and minced garlic in the last 30 seconds. Drain sausage, reserving the oil.

\ingredients{
    1 & head broccoli \\
      & more olive oil \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}

Slice broccoli stalk into thin disks about 1/8 inch. This is easier with a mandolin. Keep broccoli heads separate.

Toss in the reserved sausage oil, more olive oil and salt. Place close under the broiler for 5 minutes, until moderately blackened.

\ingredients{
    1 & box Orecchiette pasta \\
}

Boil paste until al dente, as per box instructions. Drain, reserving a bowl of the water.

Add the sausage and broccoli to the pasta. Toss to combine. Season with salt, pepper.

\ingredients{
    8 & ounces parmesan \\
}

Grate the parmesan on the finest setting. When the paste has cooled for 5 minutes, toss with cheese and reserved pasta liquid. The goal is to create a cheese sauce.

\tip {
    Great with Sriracha.
