\section{Broccoli Sausage Orecchiette}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    This recipe relies on a good parmesan cheese, and a good olive oil. Don't
    skimp on the full half cup of oil. Romano is good, too.
}

\ingredients{
               3 & large Italian sausages, or one package of sausage mix \\
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
                 & red pepper flake \\
}

Pre-heat oven to 550\degree{}.

If using sausage, remove casing from sausages with a sharp knife.

Shallow fry in olive oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat until
browned. Removed with a slotted spoon and process in a food processor for 3
short bursts. This will break up the sausage into the right sized pieces.
Return to pan and brown for another 10 minutes on medium heat.

Add red pepper flakes (even if using spicy sausage).
Drain sausage, reserving the oil.

\ingredients{
    1 & head broccoli \\
      & more olive oil \\
      & red pepper flakes \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}

Slice broccoli stalk into thin disks about 1/8 inch.

Toss in the reserved sausage oil in the now empty dutch oven. Turn out into a
foiled baking sheet, and place under the broiler until lightly blackened.

\ingredients{
    1 & box Orecchiette pasta \\
}

Boil paste until al dente, as per box instructions. Drain, reserving a bowl
of the water.

Add the sausage and broccoli to the pasta. Toss to combine.
Season with salt, pepper.

\ingredients{
    6 & ounces parmesan \\
}

Grate the parmesan on the finest setting. When the paste has cooled for 5
minutes, toss with cheese and reserved pasta liquid. The goal is to create a
cheese sauce.

\tip {
    Great with Sriracha.
}
