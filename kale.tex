\section{Kick-Ass Kale Salad}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    This salad was served by a caterer at a startup I worked for. I asked the chef about the recipe, and took copious notes so I could try to replicate it.
}

\ingredients{
    2 & heads Luciano kale \\
}

Remove the ribs of the kale by folding the leaves over lengthwise and stripping them through your curled fingers. Chop kale into ribbons of approximately \sfrac{1}{4} inch.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{2} & cup olive oil \\
    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup lemon juice \\
               2 & garlic cloves \\
}

Mince garlic and whisk ingredients together to create a vinaigrette dressing.

\ingredients{
    12 & ounces Edamame beans \\
     8 & ounces Pecorino cheese \\
       & kosher salt \\
       & pepper \\
}

\tip {
    Frozen Edamame is just fine, and so much more convenient than shelling pods. Just defrost ahead of time.
}

Grate cheese and combine ingredients in a large bowl. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Kale can take a lot of salt!

Serve with Sriracha for the adventurous.
