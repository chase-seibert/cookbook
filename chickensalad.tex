\section{Curried Chicken Salad}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    Store bought roasted chicken is also good. The slight barbeque flavor that remains after you remove the skin goes well with curry.

    Bone in, skin on chicken breast will give the meat more flavor.
}

\ingredients{
    2 & chicken breasts \\
      & salt \\
}

Salt chicken breasts, and let them rest for 1 hour. Roast in a 400\degree over until meat registers 165\degree, about 40 minutes.

Cool to room temperature, and shred with a fork.

\ingredients{
    2 & celery stalks \\
    2 & scallions \\
    2 & tablespoons cilantro \\
    1 & cup mayonnaise \\
    6 & tablespoon golden raisins \\
    2 & tablespoons lime juice \\
    2 & teaspoons curry power \\
    1 & tablespoon honey \\
      & salt \\
      & pepper \\
}

Chop celery, scallions and cilantro fine, and combine with other ingredients.

Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes before serving in sandwiches.

\subsection{Lettuce Wraps}

This can also be served in romaine lettuce leaves. In this case, I would  add chopped walnuts and sliced green grapes.
