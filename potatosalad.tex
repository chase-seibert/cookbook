\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    The two keys to this recipe are picking the right potatoes and not over-cooking them. Only russets absorb flavor well and don't break apart easily.
}

\ingredients{
    5 & pounds russet potatoes \\
    2 & tablespoons kosher salt \\
}

Peel and cut potatoes into one inch chunks. Bring a generous amount of water to boil, and submerge potatoes. Set a timer for 14 minutes. No need to wait for water to simmer again before starting the timer.

\ingredients{
    \sfrac{1}{4} & cup white vinegar \\
}

Drain and toss with vinegar. Let cool for 20 minutes.

\ingredients{
                2 & cups mayonnaise \\
                2 & celery stalks \\
                1 & small red onion \\
     \sfrac{1}{4} &  cup fresh parsley \\
    1\sfrac{1}{2} &  teaspoons celery seed \\
                1 &  teaspoon dried mustard \\
     \sfrac{1}{2} &  tablespoon dill \\
                  &  fresh pepper \\
}

Dice celery, onion and parsley fine. Whisk to combine with wet ingredients. Season to taste with pepper.

\ingredients{
    4 & eggs \\
}

Cover eggs with cold water in a small pot. Place over high heat. As soon as the water starts to boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid for 10 minutes.

Shake the pot to crack eggs shells, and replace water with cold tap water. Wait 10 minutes, and peel.

Combine the potatoes and sauce, and top with sliced eggs. Refrigerate for at least two hours, and up to a day before serving.
