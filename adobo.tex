\section{Adobo}
\begin{recipe}

\pre{
    These two sauces keep in the fridge for at least six months. I use the green adobe in scrambled eggs, pan sauces and to top tacos and chili. The red adobo I use to quickly add some heat to a dish, as a spread in a sandwich and as a spicy mix in to a salad dressing.
